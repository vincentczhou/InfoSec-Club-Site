# "It is not entry level"

When I became interested to hack, I had no shortage of resources to tell me where I should start. Many social media personalities had proclaimed the best way to start your hacking career was through entry level certifications such as `Comptia's A+`. Others professed that I must have a deep technical understanding of code. I agree with all of them. In a perfect world, an aspiring hacker would know a library full of knowledge of computer science, coding languages, and networking. For obvious reasons, this is just not feasible - for anyone. 

Instead of feeling bad for being Human, take this opportunity to look for solutions. You do not need to know a library full of knowledge to start hacking - you need to hack. Think of it this way. A locksmith that specializes in picking locks does not need to know the chemistry behind the materials the lock is made of to pick locks; similarly, a hacker does not need to know how computers work to hack a computer. If a locksmith did know the chemical makeup of said lock, he may have an advantage when looking at how to pick a lock - perhaps, the solution called for it. That said, the first lock he may have picked was when he was six years of age when his mom had hidden the cookie jar in a cabinet (the ultimate mom security control).


# Take Action, but take notes

With the multitude of machines ready to be hacked legally online, there is no excuse for you not to begin hacking this very minute. Start with machines that are labeled easy. Take vigorous notes on each machine you go through and their solutions. Over time, you yourself will figure out a way to organize the information you learned to be accessible and understandable. If you supplement this action with learning - nothing is stopping, you from becoming a great hacker.
